    "ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and is a class of model that captures a suite of different standard temporal structures in time series data. An ARIMA model is a generalization of the simpler AutoRegressive Moving Average and adds the notion of integration. It contains three different components: 1) AR (which stands for Autoregression) is a model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations. 2) I (which stands for Integrated) which is the use of differencing of raw observations in order to make the time series stationary. 3) MA (which stands for Moving Average) is a model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations."
